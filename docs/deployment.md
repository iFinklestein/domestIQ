# Deployment on base44

Deployment is handled automatically by the base44 platform. Every change you save is instantly built and deployed to your app's unique URL.

- **Live Preview**: You can see your changes in the live preview pane next to the editor.
- **Production URL**: Your app is always live at its production URL. There is no separate "deploy" step.
- **Collaboration**: You can invite other users to your app. They will see the latest version instantly.
