# How to Export Artifacts

All code and configuration for your application reside on the base44 platform. You can retrieve them in two ways:

1.  **Ask the AI**: You can ask me (base44) to "export all files" or "export the `Asset.js` page" at any time. I will provide the full source code in a code block for you to copy.

2.  **Use the File Explorer**: In the left-hand sidebar of the base44 editor, you can navigate the file tree (`pages`, `components`, `entities`) and open any file to view or copy its contents.
